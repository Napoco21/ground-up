# ground-up

This repository exists for the primary purpose of presenting all the code I have ever written from 2018 on. Much of it is unfinished, or has untidy syntax. However, this serves its purpose as a way to look back at all my accomplishments and my journey through programming. This repository contains projects that were programmed in C, C#, Java, Python, and Ruby languages. Feel free to make pull requests or issues if you find anything of interest to correct.
