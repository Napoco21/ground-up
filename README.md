# ground-up

This repository exists for the primary purpose of presenting all the code I've ever written from 2018 on. Much of it is unfinished, or has messy syntax. However, this serves its purpose as a way to look back at all my accomplishments and my journey through programming. Feel free to make pull requests or issues if you find anything of interest to correct.
